Part 1 of this project was to impliment Backdoor Poisoning attacks against a VGG-16 model. The model's purpose was to digits from the Street View House Numbers dataset. It had a classifaction accuracy of slightly under 97%. The Backdoor Poisoning Attack had a success rate of almost 96%.

Part 2 of this project was to impliment Network Intrustion Detection Attacks against a set of models; Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and a Deep-Learning Model. We implemented a white-box FGSM evasion attack and a Jacobian Saliency Mapp Attack against the deep-learning model and a white-box FGSM attack against the Logistric Regression model.

Throughout these two parts are several summaries of how different parts work and analysis of the success of the attacks.
